# Baldur's Gate 3 Community Library

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Community-Library?label=Latest%20Version)](https://GitHub.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Community-Library/releases/) [![GitHub commits](https://img.shields.io/github/commits-since/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Community-Library/2.2.8.0/main)](https://GitHub.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Community-Library/commit/)

Baldur's Gate 3 Community Library exists to provide a common collection of
Spells, Scripts, Items, Statuses, Passives, and other useful material that will
assist modders in creating new content.

Note that some of this information may be out of date - we're working on cleaning off the cobwebs as we raise the project back from the dead.

## For Mod Authors:
In addition to the stated purpose of this mod, feel free to use the contents of
this mod as examples of how to create certain content for Baldur's Gate 3 if you
wish. See [here](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Community-Library/wiki/Using-Community-Library-Content) to find out how to use the
library's content in your own mods!

You're welcome to submit pieces of your mod that you think would be useful for
others to use in their mods as well, be it scripts, spells, statuses, passives,
models, textures, sounds, etc.

## For Players:
Some mods will rely on this one, and require it as a dependency, as it provides the content it contains. If none of your mods require this one, you don't need to install it.

### I heard this mod makes Subclasses Compatible?
As of 2.0.4.1, this mod no longer includes the [Compatibility Framework](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Compatibility-Framework), which has been separated out into it's own project. Compatibility Framework _does_ rely on Lua functions defined within the Community Library.

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possible Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
